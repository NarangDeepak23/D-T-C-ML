# D-T-C-ML
An exercise on "Decision Tree Classifier"
First Exercise:
Dataset: Heart Diseasr
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V.
It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. 
The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. 
It is an integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

Second Exercise:
DataSet: iris Dataset
The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, 
The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems can also be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each and some properties about each flower. 
One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

Id
SepalLengthCm
SepalWidthCm
PetalLengthCm
PetalWidthCm
Species: 
target_names': (['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica']
